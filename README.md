# Pi-Stop Documentation #

The following material is available:

[**Discover: The Pi-Stop**](Discover-PiStop.md): Learn what the Pi-Stop is, what is it for and how to use it.

[**Setup: Scratch GPIO**](Setup-ScratchGPIO.md): Get up and running with Scratch GPIO ready to use with the Pi-Stop.

[**Explore and Challenge Scratch GPIO: Pi-Stop First Steps**](ExploreScratchGPIO-PiStopFirstSteps.md): If you've not used Scratch before, this will provide a quick introduction to building your first Scratch GPIO program.

[**Explore and Challenge Scratch GPIO: Pi-Stop Traffic Sequence**](ExploreScratchGPIO-PiStopTrafficSequence.md)

# Workshop Materials #
The workshop materials will be split into four areas:

**Discover**: This will provide useful reference information for the user which will be useful later on.

**Setup**: This contains important information on how to setup your system correctly before you start.

**Explore and Challenge**: Step by step guide to gradually introduce the concepts and ideas while applying existing skills and knowledge.  These provide an introduction with clear walk-through to a solution, making it an excellent place to get started. 

**Create and Solve**: We encouraging problem solving by presenting a problem, and providing the components to a possible solution.

Supporting worksheets:

**Worksheets**: The workshop is structured using the worksheets which will tie together the materials, provide space for note taking and a means to keep track of progress.
